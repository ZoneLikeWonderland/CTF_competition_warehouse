In this question, a Lorenz encryption machine is explained and a string is encrypted using the key. Please reverse the app and find the key of the encrypting algorithm, and input the string in the Android app. A Lorenz encryption machine uses 12 wheels, each with 23 ~ 61 lowered or raised cams, to randomly generate 12 binary numbers (chi1~chi5, mu37, mu61, psi1~psi5) with the respective length of 23 ~ 61 bits. For example, one random number (chi5) is of length 23: 0101 0000 0111 0101 0101 011. ( FYI: In the mechanical cipher, the lowered cam means 0 and the raised cam means 1. ) Then use the key e.g. XYZ to form the flag in the style of DDCTF{XYZ}
