Deep Encrypt
Hi, Ming has recently trained a deep encrypt model having used the 'flag_sampe.txt' and the 'enc_sample.txt'.

There are totally 512 samples in 'flag_sample.txt' and for each line in the file represents a flag sample. As the same, there are also 512 "encrypted" data in the 'enc_sample.txt' and for each line represents the "encrypted" result for the flag in the same line in 'flag_sample.txt'.

The 'enc.hdf5' is the model that Ming has trained.

Model Input shape: (128, )

Model Output shape: (64, )

Here is also a encrypted flag 'flag_enc.txt' which is encrypted by the model. Can you give me the raw flag to crack this "Deep Encrypt" model?
