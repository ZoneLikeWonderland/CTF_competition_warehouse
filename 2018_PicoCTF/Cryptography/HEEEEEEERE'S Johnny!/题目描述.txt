Okay, so we found some important looking files on a linux computer. Maybe they can be used to get a password to the process. Connect with nc 2018shell2.picoctf.com 40157. Files can be found here: passwd shadow.
If at first you don't succeed, try, try again. And again. And again.
If you're not careful these kind of problems can really "rockyou".
