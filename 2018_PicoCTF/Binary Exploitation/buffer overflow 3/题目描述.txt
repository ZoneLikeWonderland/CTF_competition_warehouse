It looks like Dr. Xernon added a stack canary to this program to protect against buffer overflows. Do you think you can bypass the protection and get the flag? You can find it in /problems/buffer-overflow-3_1_2e6726e5326a80f8f5a9c350284e6c7f. Source.
Maybe there's a smart way to brute-force the canary?
