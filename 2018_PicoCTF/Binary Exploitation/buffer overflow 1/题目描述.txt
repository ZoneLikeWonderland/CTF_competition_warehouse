Okay now you're cooking! This time can you overflow the buffer and return to the flag function in this program? You can find it in /problems/buffer-overflow-1_1_8a16ff6a1b3cfb2e42c08d9090051a5d on the shell server. Source.
This time you're actually going to have to control that return address!
Make sure you consider Big Endian vs Little Endian.
