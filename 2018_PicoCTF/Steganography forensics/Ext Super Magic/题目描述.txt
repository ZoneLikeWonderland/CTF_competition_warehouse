We salvaged a ruined Ext SuperMagic II-class mech recently and pulled the filesystem out of the black box. It looks a bit corrupted, but maybe there's something interesting in there. You can also find it in /problems/ext-super-magic_0_621bc2a94057a3e5a0aa0816da3fe8fb on the shell server.
Are there any tools£¨https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fsck£© for diagnosing corrupted filesystems? What do they say if you run them on this one?
How does a linux machine know what type£¨https://www.garykessler.net/library/file_sigs.html£© of file a file£¨https://linux.die.net/man/1/file£© is?
You might find this doc£¨http://www.nongnu.org/ext2-doc/ext2.html£© helpful.
Be careful with endianness£¨https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness£© when making edits.
Once you've fixed the corruption, you can use /sbin/debugfs£¨https://linux.die.net/man/8/debugfs£© to pull the flag file out.
