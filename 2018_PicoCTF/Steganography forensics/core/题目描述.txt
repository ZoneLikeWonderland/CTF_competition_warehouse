This program was about to print the flag when it died. Maybe the flag is still in this core file that it dumped? Also available at /problems/core_1_722685357ac5a814524ee76a3dcd1521 on the shell server.
What is a core file?
You may find this reference£¨http://darkdust.net/files/GDB%20Cheat%20Sheet.pdf£© helpful.
Try to figure out where the flag was read into memory using the disassembly and strace£¨https://linux.die.net/man/1/strace£©.
You should study the format options on the cheat sheet and use the examine (x) or print (p) commands. disas may also be useful.
